This is the directory where you should place your OpenVDB files. I would like to import them directly to this repo,
however I'm pretty confident that even though they're free, I'm not allowed to place them here.

You must place some OpenVDB files here. Otherwise you may have some trouble running this application without any
content.

Download them from here: https://www.3dart.it/free-vdb-clouds/

Name them accordingly:

```
cloud-hd.vdb
cloud-md.vdb
cloud-ld.vdb
```

You can use totally different files as long as they have "density" float grid.
